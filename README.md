## About Me

I am a results-driven software engineer specializing in building scalable, production-grade applications using modern web technologies. Currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science with a focus on Industrial IoT at GLA University, Mathura, I combine strong fundamentals in data structures, algorithms, and system design with hands-on expertise in full-stack development.

My passion lies in creating intelligent systems that bridge software engineering, artificial intelligence, and IoT. I am actively preparing for roles at top product companies including Microsoft and Juspay, with a focus on writing clean, maintainable code and architecting robust distributed systems.
